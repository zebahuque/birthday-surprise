This is a simple, two-page website for a birthday surprise. The first page has a button that leads to a second page, which displays a "Happy Birthday!" message with an animated bouquet of flowers appearing underneath.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

You can host this website for free on GitHub Pages. Here's how:

1.  **Push the code to a GitHub repository.** If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub and push the code to it.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages.** In your repository's settings, go to the "Pages" tab. Under "Source," select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`) and click "Save."

3.  **Share the link!** GitHub will generate a link to your live website. It might take a few minutes to go live. You can share this link with anyone!
